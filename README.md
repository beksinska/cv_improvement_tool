# Ciwi

## TASKS

1. **22 Oct**: Name, Project (little description) and GitHub [5 Points] - Done
2. **01st Dec**: First Deliverable with good content [15 Points] - Done
3. **20th Jan**: Final GitHub with all Tasks

**A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. The code in GitHub can be relatively simple (e.g., a game with console output). The doc can be short! (in contrast to the one below)** - Done: [here](https://github.com/beksinska/ciwi)

**B**) Make sure each person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture:

1. Use and understand **Git!** Be able to apply the basic commands. Can you experiment with time travelling or branches/merges? **Done.**
2. **UML**: [here](https://github.com/beksinska/cv_improvement_tool/tree/main/software_engineering_tasks/uml)
3. **Requirements**: [here]([https://github.com/beksinska/cv_improvement_tool/blob/main/software_engineering_tasks/requirements.md](https://vintage-snowboard-5bd.notion.site/Requirements-17ac7d8ad36180f0b780fd1889f39b9d?pvs=4))
4. **Analysis**: [here](https://github.com/beksinska/cv_improvement_tool/blob/main/software_engineering_tasks/Analysis.pdf)
5. **DDD**: [here](https://github.com/beksinska/cv_improvement_tool/tree/main/software_engineering_tasks/ddd)
6. **Metrics** at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.
7. **Clean Code Development:** A) At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.
8. **Build** Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) => to be merged with 7!
9. **Continuous Delivery:** [here](https://github.com/beksinska/GitHubActions)
10. Integrate some nice **unit tests** in your Code to be integrated into the Build
11. Use a good **IDE** and get fluent with it: e.g. VSCode, IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!
12. AI Coding: Set Up an AI-coding environment on your computer like ZED, Aider, etc. Show your steps and personal experiences! 
13. **Functional Programming:** prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
    - only final data structures
    - (mostly) side-effect-free functions
    - the use of higher-order functions
    - functions as parameters and return values
    - use closures / anonymous functions
    - You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.

**The complete documentation must be found in a public GitHub or the system you use.**

**For B) Please give me a hint as a checklist for each numbered 1-13 points (!!!): where I can find the info for your solutions best as links (!) in the README.md !! (e.g. to code)**

**It must explain also part B in 1-2 paragraphs per point! So list the 11 numbered points here and use links here to refer to the respective files (e.g. the CCD files or test files)!**

The contribution in Moodle is just **a Link to GitHub in the comment section**!

And: I do not want to receive 50 invitations to your repo, because your repo is private! Make it public and close it a few days after the grading! (see FAQ)

Another final remark: Mostly, I want **your personal experiences** with Screenshots and personal text!

Please do not write or generate ChatGPT content like "a DSL is blah blah blah, Build Management is blah blah blah...".

This is not needed, and LLM / internet-generated content will result in failing the course!
